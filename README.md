# Secure-ECC-and-AES-GCM-Message-Encryption
This Python script showcases secure message encryption and decryption using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for key exchange and AES-GCM for symmetric encryption. Encrypt messages for friends and decrypt received messages with ease. Save encrypted and decrypted messages in separate files for convenience.
